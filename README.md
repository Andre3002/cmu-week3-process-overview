Very important to note that when looking at the python examples 5a and 6a, the dataset is in a very information-dense format

Column 1 called "data" is a column of array data.  Each row in this column contains [5.1, 3.2, 1.4, 0.2] coresponding to (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) 

Column 2 is the target variable encoded to 0, 1, or 2 based on if the plant type is setosa, versicolor or virginica

Column 4 contains just 3 rows, representing the list of unique target names (setosa, versicolor or virginica)

Column 6 has 4 rows, which are the list of feature names
